# CS445-NLP
Reyyan Yeniterzi was an amazing instructor &lt;3
Project 1: nltk + binary and multiclass  naive bayes (using pipeline and gridsearch) + binary and multiclass logistic regression (pipeline&gridsearch)  
+CNN with custom and preexisting corpus Word2Vec embedding matrices with gridsearch and custom word embedding with gridsearch (all 3 for binary and multiclass)  
   
Project 2: Gazetteer creation+ CRF (adding a featurea at a time and comparing results) + CNN ( with above mentioned 3 ways of word embeddings)  
+RNN (3 different word embeddings again with a little feat optimization)
